1	Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
2	Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
3	Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
4	And summer's lease hath all too short a date:
5	Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
6	And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;
7	And every fair from fair sometime declines,
8	By chance, or nature's changing course, untrimm'd;
9	But thy eternal summer shall not fade
10	Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st;
11	Nor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade,
12	When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st;
13	So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
14	So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
