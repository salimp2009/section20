// Thread_Local Example;
// thread-local storage, is created for each thread separately. 
// It behaves like static data because itâ€™s bound for 
// the lifetime of the thread and is created at its first usage. 
// This means exactly that thread-local variables at namespace scope 
// or as static class members are created before its first use 
// and that thread-local variables declared in a function are created 
// with its first use. 
// Thread-local data belongs exclusively to the thread.

// A static variable is bound to the lifetime of the main thread, 
// a thread_local variable is bound to the lifetime of its thread, 
// a local variable is bound to the lifetime of the scope in which it was created.
